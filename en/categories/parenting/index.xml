      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is time to potty train the Little One (LO).
The objective is to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) so the LO pisses in the toilet instead of his diaper.
The idea of RL is to keep LO on his potty until he accidentally pisses into that.
Then mommy and daddy are ecstatic, jumping up and down with enormous joy,
giving him lots of kisses, stickers and chocolates.
We need to repeat the process over and over again to reinforce the good behavior into the little cute tiny brain of LO.
It is simple but it is not easy.
Survival analysis might come handy.
